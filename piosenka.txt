I'm pulling out my parachute
And I'm jumping from the plane we flew
First, I'm gonna tell the truth
But then I'm burning my bridge to you


I'm pulling out my parachute
And I'm jumping from the plane we flew
First, I'm gonna tell the truth
But then I'm burning my bridge to you

Don't lie
You're lying through your teeth
And don't try to touch me
I'm afraid of your disease

I'm pulling out my parachute
And I'm jumping from the plane we flew
First, I'm gonna tell the truth
But then I'm burning my bridge to you
