Sweetness
I can read your mind
I see your skin turn red
When you lie
If you don't wanna tell me nothing
Then you can go straight to hell
Now I'm gonna tell you something
You fucked this up yourself
I'm pulling out my parachute
And I'm jumping from the plane we flew
First, I'm gonna tell the truth
But then I'm burning my bridge to you
One step
Was all it really took
And I don't know your story
But girl I've read your book
If you don't wanna tell me nothing
Then you can go straight to hell
But first I'm gonna show you something
You fucked this up yourself
I'm pulling out my parachute
And I'm jumping from the plane we flew
First, I'm gonna tell the truth
But then I'm burning my bridge to you
Don't lie
You're lying through your teeth
And don't try to touch me
I'm afraid of your disease
I'm pulling out my parachute
And I'm jumping from the plane we flew
First, I'm gonna tell the truth
But then I'm burning my bridge to you
